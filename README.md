# Logic Problems
# 🧠 Logic Problems & Algorithm Solutions

Welcome to my dedicated space for solving complex logical challenges. As I advance my journey as a **Full-Stack Developer** and **AI Integration Specialist**, this repository serves as the brain-gym where I sharpen my problem-solving skills using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and modern algorithmic patterns.

## 🚀 The Mission
Mastering technologies like **Next.js** and **AI Integration** requires deep logical clarity. In this repository, I document my solutions to various:
- Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) problems.
- Logical puzzles translated into clean code.
- Smart web logic for AI-driven applications.
- Type-safe logic implementation using **TypeScript**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack for Solutions
- **TypeScript:** For robust and type-safe logic.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For flexible problem-solving.
- **Node.js:** To run and test logical scripts locally.
